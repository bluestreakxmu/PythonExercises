"""抽认卡片挑战。

Write a Python script that takes a file containing flash card questions
    and answers as an argument and quizzes the user based on the contents of
    that file until the user quits the program.
Questions should be selected randomly (as opposed to going in order through the file),
    and the user should type in their guess.
The script should say whether or not a guess is correct and provide the correct answer
    if an incorrect answer is given.

For more information, see：http://wiki.openhatch.org/Flash_card_challenge
